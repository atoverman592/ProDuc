### What is the goal of ProDuc?
Many students and professionals have difficulty organizing their complicated lives. The combination of personal events, school, and work can be overwhelming and managing time effectively and efficiently is a skill that not many people have mastered. ProDuc is a collection of tools to help organize, manage, and control your personal life, professional life, and/or student life. 

### To execute ProDuc on your machine:
ProDuc is implemented as a standalone Java executable that will run in an IDE (Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ, etc.). To run ProDuc locally, follow these steps:
- Clone this GitHub repository into a folder on your machine or download all of the files onto your machine.
- Open your preferred IDE, create a new project, and copy all of the files into this project folder.
- There are two .jar files that are necessary for the successful execution of ProDuc (javax.mail.jar and jcalendar-1.4.jar). Add these files to the build path of the project that was created (note that this process may be different depending on the IDE used).
- The file Main_Launch.java contains the main method that executes the program. Run this file in your IDE and the rest should follow suit.
